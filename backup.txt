Create an Express.js app that outputs "Hello World!" when somebody goes to /home.

The port number will be provided to you by {appname} as the first argument of the application, i.e., process.argv[2].

Don't forget to install the Express module if you haven't already.

$ npm install express --save

In your solution, please use process.argv[2] instead of a fixed port number:

app.listen(process.argv[2])

Write an express app that does the following

As a user when I go to the path /reverse any text I add after the second / will be reversed

ex:

http://localhost:3000/add?a=5&b=6

results in "11"

As a user when I go to the path /piglatin any text I add after the second slash is displayed, but in pig latin. Plus signs (+) are converted to spaces in the output.

ex:
